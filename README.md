# Technologies used:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript


# Approach:

Used the original Simon Says game as inspiration.
I wanted it to be different than the original but similar concept. 
The first thing I did was wireframe or what I wanted the game to look like. 
Then I thought about functionality. 

# Summary 

The object of the game is to keep up with the what the computer choice. 
There is 4 black squares, on the first round the computer will randomly light up one of them in yellow.
It is then the players turn and the object is to "click" the same button. Then it goes back to computer turn, 
each round is incrementing so round 2 will have 2 buttons light up one after another creating a patern. 
Computer and player alternate turns.

# Challenges:

I had originally made the game similar to the original as in there is no end. The rounds keep on incrementing for as long as the player can mimic that same pattern.
One of the deliverables in the game was to have a winner. It was challenging to end my game since I had designed it without this logic. I was able to overcome this,
and for the sake of the class requirement and presentation I gave it a winning round of 3. My other challenge is my start button. I can get it to start the game
but at times it does not register when the right button is clicked by the user so I am currently working on that.
